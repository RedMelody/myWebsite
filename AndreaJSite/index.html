    <h2 >About Me</h2>
    <p class="summary">Howdy there, I'm Andrea Jaimes and I am a programmer looking for work. I grew up in Austin,TX and have an obsession with Y2K fashion and bass guitars. I went to Austin Community College and studied 2D animation with programs such as ToonBoom Harmony and Storyboard Pro, TV Paint, Clip Studio Paint, and Adobe After Effects. I am currently pursuing a career in software development to fill in the other major I wanted to take as well as eventually learn how to supercharge animation programs and their assets</p>

<!-- I want to link git hub repositories to my two other site projects along with the links to those websites
I eventually want to add in illustrations animated with After Effects
have a loading screen with a bunny dumpling jump animation
custom cursor
cleaner UI, more smooth but not overanimated-->
